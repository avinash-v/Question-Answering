Scientists know many things about the Sun. They know how old it is. The Sun is more than 4½
billion years old. They also know the Sun’s size. The Sun may seem small, but that is because it is
so far away. It is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from the Earth. The Sun is
so large that the diameter of the Sun is  109 times the Earth’s diameter. The Sun also weighs as
much as 333,000 Earths. The Sun is the center of our Solar System. Besides the Sun, the Solar
System is made up of the planets,  moons, asteroid belt, comets, meteors, and other objects.
